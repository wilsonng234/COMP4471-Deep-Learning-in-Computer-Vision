HKUST COMP4471 Deep Learning in Computer Vision - Assignment Repository  

# Assignment1
> [Q1](assignment1/knn.ipynb): k-Nearest Neighbor classifier  
> The IPython Notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

> [Q2](assignment1/svm.ipynb): Training a Support Vector Machine  
> The IPython Notebook svm.ipynb will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

> [Q3](assignment1/softmax.ipynb): Implement a Softmax classifier  
> The IPython Notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

> [Q4](assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb): Two-Layer Neural Network  
> The IPython Notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

> [Q5](assignment1/features.ipynb): Two-Layer Neural Network  
> The IPython Notebook features.ipynb will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

# Assignment2
> [Q1](assignment2/FullyConnectedNets.ipynb): Fully-connected Neural Network  
The IPython notebook FullyConnectedNets.ipynb will introduce you to our modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several popular update rules.

> [Q2](assignment2/BatchNormalization.ipynb): Batch Normalization  
In the IPython notebook BatchNormalization.ipynb you will implement batch normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

> [Q3](assignment2/Dropout.ipynb): Dropout  
> The IPython notebook Dropout.ipynb will help you implement Dropout and explore its effects on model generalization.

> [Q4](assignment2/ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb): Convolutional Networks  
> In the IPython Notebook ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

> [Q5](assignment2/PyTorch.ipynb): PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10  
> For this last part, you will be working in either TensorFlow or PyTorch, two popular and powerful deep learning frameworks. You only need to complete ONE of these two notebooks.
