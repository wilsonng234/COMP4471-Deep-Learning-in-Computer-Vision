# Assignment1
> [Q1](assignment1/knn.ipynb): k-Nearest Neighbor classifier  
> The IPython Notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

> [Q2](assignment1/svm.ipynb): Training a Support Vector Machine  
> The IPython Notebook svm.ipynb will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

> [Q3](assignment1/softmax.ipynb): Implement a Softmax classifier  
> The IPython Notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

> [Q4](assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb): Two-Layer Neural Network  
> The IPython Notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

> [Q5](assignment1/features.ipynb): Two-Layer Neural Network  
> The IPython Notebook features.ipynb will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.
